* Move larger parts of README to the GitHub wiki so the README is to the point.
* Add a recipe which implements the basic autotest mapping API.
* Make the loggers, stdout and growl, work in a chain so one can add others.
  This should improve portability as well, as people can easily insert growl
  alternatives for their platform.
