* Add a way that recipe files are loaded, but not queued until the app starts.
  This way a recipe can add options to the option parser, such as the runner bin on the ruby recipe.
  Afterwards remove the ruby test related methods and options from older code.
* Cleanup mustache kick file. See GitHub issue #3.
* Add a recipe which implements the basic autotest mapping API.
