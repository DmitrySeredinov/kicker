* Cleanup mustache kick file. See GitHub issue #3.
* Write/update docs.
* Add a recipe which implements the basic autotest mapping API.
* Make the loggers, stdout and growl, work in a chain so one can add others.
  This should improve portability as well, as people can easily insert growl
  alternatives for their platform.
